        ✔ listItem - Add an NFT to the marketplace
        ✔ purchase - Purchase NFT that is listed in the marketplace 
    
    MyERC721 Contract - dummy ERC721 contract - to be used for testing purpose only
        ✔ Extends ERC721

# Tests - test/tests.js

    Test approve/transfer tokens
        ✔ Create CUTE and BOOBLES NFT tokens

        ✔ Transfer CUTE NFTs to the marketplace
        ✔ Check if the transfered NFTs belong now to the marketplace
        ✔ Transfer BOOBLES NFTs to the marketplace
        ✔ Check if the transfered NFTs belong now to the marketplace
        ✔ Try to do different purchases with different conditions just to test the require in each function
